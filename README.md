## summer programs
normally, summer programs that cost money aren't worth it. go get a job or an internship or volunteer or do a passion project or something. HOWEVER, summer sessions at a university are somewhat helpful (especially in giving you a sense of the overall vibe of the college and helping with WHY US essays), though they cost a lot. also, lots of math summer programs aren't free, but are undoubtedly worth it (mathcamp, promys, ross, etc.). 

if you do decide to go to a paid summer program, make sure to check for financial aid. pester their email a lot and really beg for it (don't be annoying though). 

now for my list of summer programs:
